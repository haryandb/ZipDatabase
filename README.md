# ZipCache: Fast ZIP Archive Content Search & Extraction

ZipCache is a desktop application built with Tauri (Rust backend, TypeScript/HTML/CSS frontend) designed to efficiently cache and search the contents of large ZIP archives. It allows users to quickly find specific files within numerous ZIP files without extracting them all, and provides convenient extraction and file location features.

## Features:

-   **Cache Building:** Scan a specified directory to build a searchable cache of all files contained within `.zip` archives.
-   **Fast Search:** Quickly search for files by name across all cached ZIP archives.
-   **Paginated Results:** Browse search results with pagination (20, 50, or 150 items per page).
-   **Individual File Extraction:** Extract any found file directly from its ZIP archive to your Downloads folder.
-   **Reveal in File Explorer:** After extraction, automatically open the extracted file's location in your operating system's file explorer (Finder on macOS, Explorer on Windows, etc.).
-   **Fullscreen Mode:** Launches in fullscreen for an immersive experience.

## Technologies Used:

-   **Tauri:** For building cross-platform desktop applications with web technologies.
-   **Rust:** For the high-performance backend logic, including ZIP archive processing and SQLite database management.
-   **TypeScript:** For the interactive and dynamic frontend.
-   **SQLite:** For caching file metadata for fast search operations.
-   **Pico.css:** A minimal CSS framework for a clean UI.
